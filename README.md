Static Site Starter Template
============================

A starting point for a simple static site.

## Getting Started

1. Check out the repo: `git clone https://github.com/adamaveray/static-site-starter-template.git`
2. Set the site name and initial `templateVars` values in `package.json`
3. Install dependencies: `yarn`
4. Begin watch script & development server: `yarn run build & yarn run server & wait`
5. Auto-format and lint code after development: `yarn run format` and `yarn run lint`

## Docs

### Inline critical SVGs

To prevent separate requests for SVGs critical to the site layout, such as logos, replace `url(...)` with `inline-url(...)` in stylesheets. Inlining will only be performed for production builds.

### Auto asset versioning

Automatic querystrings can be appended to asset links ... `{{ asset(...) }}` in Nunjucks templates.

### Generating multiple image sizes

Images in the `src/img` directory will be automatically optimised and copied to the built `img` folder, however multiple sizes can be generated by declaring an entry in `dev/image-sizes.json`. Keys should be paths to the image (relative to the `src/img` directory), and values should be objects with the following format:

- Keys are paths to output to (will be relative to the same directory). Prepending a path with `~` will append the remaining content to the name 
- Values are either:
    - A simple array: `[width: number, height: number, crop?: number]` (e.g. `[500, 300]`, `[250, 250, true]`)
    - An object with custom settings (see [available properties](https://github.com/dcgauld/gulp-responsive-images#options))

```json
{
    "example/full.jpg": {
        "thumb.jpg": [250, 250, true],
        "full.jpg": [1200, 800]
    }
}
```

### Copying additional static files

Declare the files in `package.json` under `config` â†’ `copyFiles`
